## Description

OH! HERE WE GO AGAIN! 
Have you ever had a huge loss because you didn't have actual information about Crypto? Now, that is in the past! With my solutions, you can check real-time information on your favourite tokens. Bitcoin? Ethereum? Pepe? Everything is in here! Come inside—don't be a stranger!

## Functionality

Easy-peasy lemon... squezy? 
Easy as it gets - using the same old HTML, some magic of CSS and script for fancy stuff on JS. The metrics come from [Coinranking](https://coinranking.com/)

- **Price Tracking** — displays current cryptocurrency prices.
- **Filtering and Search** — allows users to filter by cryptocurrency name or symbol.
- **Multi-Currency Support** — displays prices in different currencies (e.g., USD, EUR).
- **Real-Time Data Updates** — refreshes prices in real-time.

## Technologies

- **Frontend**: HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Bootstrap.
- **Backend**: Requests to APIs for cryptocurrency data (e.g., [CoinGecko API](https://www.coingecko.com/en/api)).
- **Integrations**: Ability to add additional APIs for broader capabilities (e.g., Binance API).
